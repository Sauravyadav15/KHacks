## Part 1: Introduction to Subtraction (Easy)

### What is Subtraction?
Subtraction means **taking away** or removing items from a group. When you subtract, you end up with fewer items than you started with.

**Key vocabulary:**
- **Minus (-)**: The subtraction symbol
- **Take away**: Remove or subtract
- **Difference**: The answer to a subtraction problem

### Basic Examples
1. You have 5 apples. You eat 2 apples. How many apples are left?
   - 5 - 2 = 3 apples

2. There are 8 birds on a tree. 3 birds fly away. How many birds remain?
   - 8 - 3 = 5 birds

3. A basket has 10 eggs. You use 4 eggs for breakfast. How many eggs are left?
   - 10 - 4 = 6 eggs

### Practice Problems (Easy)
1. 7 - 3 = ?
2. 9 - 5 = ?
3. 6 - 2 = ?
4. 10 - 6 = ?
5. 8 - 4 = ?

**Real-world scenario:**
You have 12 cookies. You give 7 cookies to your friends. How many cookies do you have left?

## Part 2: Subtraction Strategies (Medium)

### Strategy 1: Counting Backwards
Start at the larger number and count backwards.

**Example:** 15 - 6 = ?
- Start at 15: "15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9"
- Count back 6 numbers
- Answer: 9

### Strategy 2: Using a Number Line
Draw a number line and jump backwards.

**Example:** 13 - 5 = ?
```
<--5--
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
                    ↑           ↑
                  Answer      Start
```
- Start at 13, jump back 5 spaces
- Land on 8
- Answer: 8

### Strategy 3: Think Addition (Fact Families)
If you know 7 + 5 = 12, then you know:
- 12 - 7 = 5
- 12 - 5 = 7

**Example:** 14 - 9 = ?
- Think: "What plus 9 equals 14?"
- 5 + 9 = 14, so 14 - 9 = 5

### Practice Problems (Medium)
1. 15 - 8 = ?
2. 17 - 9 = ?
3. 20 - 12 = ?
4. 16 - 7 = ?
5. 18 - 11 = ?

**Real-world scenario:**
You have $20. You buy a toy for $13. How much money do you have left?

## Part 3: Two-Digit Subtraction (Hard)

### Subtraction Without Regrouping
When the ones digit in the top number is larger than the ones digit in the bottom number.

**Example:** 47 - 23 = ?
```
  47
- 23
----
  24
```
Steps:
1. Subtract the ones place: 7 - 3 = 4
2. Subtract the tens place: 4 - 2 = 2
3. Answer: 24

### Subtraction With Regrouping (Borrowing)
When the ones digit in the bottom number is larger, we need to borrow from the tens place.

**Example:** 52 - 27 = ?
```
  4 12      (borrowed 1 ten, so 5 becomes 4, and 2 becomes 12)
  52
- 27
----
  25
```
Steps:
1. Look at ones place: 2 is less than 7, so we need to borrow
2. Borrow 1 ten from the tens place (5 tens becomes 4 tens)
3. Add 10 to the ones place (2 becomes 12)
4. Subtract ones: 12 - 7 = 5
5. Subtract tens: 4 - 2 = 2
6. Answer: 25

### More Examples with Regrouping
1. **Example:** 64 - 38 = ?
   ```
     5 14
     64
   - 38
   ----
     26
   ```

2. **Example:** 81 - 49 = ?
   ```
     7 11
     81
   - 49
   ----
     32
   ```

### Practice Problems (Hard)
1. 56 - 29 = ?
2. 73 - 48 = ?
3. 90 - 67 = ?
4. 85 - 56 = ?
5. 62 - 38 = ?

**Real-world scenario:**
A library has 75 books on a shelf. Students check out 48 books. How many books are still on the shelf?

## Part 4: Word Problems

### Easy Level
1. There are 9 ducks in a pond. 4 ducks swim away. How many ducks are left?

2. Maria has 11 stickers. She gives 6 to her brother. How many stickers does Maria have now?

3. A tree has 15 leaves. 8 leaves fall off. How many leaves remain on the tree?

### Medium Level
1. John scored 18 points in a basketball game. His friend scored 11 points. How many more points did John score than his friend?

2. A farmer had 20 chickens. He sold 13 chickens at the market. How many chickens does he have left?

3. There were 17 students in class. 9 students went to recess. How many students stayed in the classroom?

### Hard Level

2. Mom bought 95 flowers. She used 58 flowers to decorate the house. How many flowers are left?

3. A parking lot has 72 cars. During lunchtime, 45 cars leave. How many cars remain in the parking lot?

## Part 5: Subtraction with Zero

### Special Cases
1. **Subtracting zero:** Any number minus 0 equals that same number
   - 7 - 0 = 7
   - 15 - 0 = 15

2. **Subtracting from zero:** 0 minus any number gives a negative number (but we don't use negatives yet!)
   - We can't take away more than we have
   - 0 - 5 = "impossible" (in elementary math)

3. **Subtracting a number from itself:** Any number minus itself equals 0
   - 9 - 9 = 0
   - 14 - 14 = 0

### Practice Problems
1. 12 - 0 = ?
2. 8 - 8 = ?
3. 20 - 0 = ?
4. 15 - 15 = ?

## Part 6: Challenge Problems

## Tips for Teachers

1. **Use visual aids:** Use blocks, counters, or pictures to show subtraction physically
2. **Start concrete, move abstract:** Begin with real objects before moving to numbers on paper
3. **Practice daily:** Regular short practice is better than long sessions
4. **Make it fun:** Use games, stories, and real-life examples
5. **Celebrate mistakes:** Mistakes are learning opportunities
6. **Connect to addition:** Show how subtraction and addition are related
7. **Use technology:** Interactive apps and games can reinforce skills

## Common Mistakes to Watch For

1. **Subtracting smaller from larger regardless of position**
   - Wrong: 52 - 27 = 35 (they did 7 - 2 instead of borrowing)
   - Right: 52 - 27 = 25 (with proper borrowing)

2. **Forgetting to reduce the tens digit after borrowing**
   - They borrow but forget to reduce the tens place

3. **Not lining up numbers correctly**
   - Numbers should be aligned by place value (ones under ones, tens under tens)

4. **Confusing subtraction with addition**
   - Mixing up the operations in word problems
