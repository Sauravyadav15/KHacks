# KHacks
It's Hakathon project, AI-powered learning feedback platform where teachers upload lecture materials and students answer adaptive, concept-focused questions. The system provides hints instead of answers, tracks accuracy and struggle points, and generates summarized reports to help instructors identify learning gaps and adjust teaching strategies.
